# Inspiration & Sources

Public sources whose content and ideas were distilled into this skill. Where text was adapted
substantially (not just referenced), the license is noted.

## Direct content sources

- **[spf13/go-skills](https://github.com/spf13/go-skills)** (MIT) — by Steve Francia (spf13),
  author of Cobra, Viper, Hugo, Afero; former Go team. The largest external contribution:
  `reference/cli.md` (Cobra/Viper architecture), `reference/release.md` (semver, gorelease,
  retract, GoReleaser), `reference/wails.md` (v2/v3), `reference/files.md`
  (fileflow/pathologize), and substantial parts of `reference/modern-go.md`, `reference/http.md`,
  `reference/logging.md`, `reference/packages.md`, `reference/debugging.md`, plus the
  spec-review chunk's philosophy. His "stop writing Java in Go" framing echoes throughout.
- **[Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)** — naming (getters drop `Get`, MixedCaps,
  interface `-er` names), errors, data structures, concurrency foundations across the rubric.
- **[Go Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments)** — initialism casing,
  receiver names, error strings, doc-comment conventions, in-band errors.
- **[Google Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/)** — the five core principles
  in priority order (clarity > simplicity > concision > maintainability > consistency) and
  least-mechanism, in `rubric/principles.md`.
- **[Go Proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io/)** (Rob Pike) — "clear is better than clever",
  "a little copying is better than a little dependency", "the bigger the interface, the weaker
  the abstraction", "share memory by communicating".
- **[Go release notes & blog](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release)** (go.dev) — the modern-Go
  currency catalog (1.18–1.25): `slices`/`maps`/`cmp`, iterators, `synctest`, `omitzero`,
  `math/rand/v2`, ServeMux routing, and the rest of `reference/modern-go.md`.
- **[Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve)** documentation — the scriptable invocations
  (`--init` scripts, `dlv trace`, headless usage) in `reference/delve.md`.

## Structural inspiration

- **[Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io)** — the progressive-disclosure skill format:
  a small always-loaded SKILL.md routing to detail files loaded on demand.
- **Zettelkasten method** (Niklas Luhmann) — atomic, linked decision records in
  `rubric/decisions.md`.

## Primary source

The rubric's judgment — single-word naming, the adversarial gauntlet, gateway interfaces,
consumer-defined dependencies, surface coherence, kit/app modes, and the settled rulings — was
distilled from the author's own design work on the agentkit ecosystem, not from external sources.
